## UI Details.

Since the requirements are not as defined a good step would be to conceptualise the actions the user could take while interacting with the app.
We start with a rough user flow diagram in which the user opens the app and interacts with it. Depending on different scenarions certain actions can affect the user expreience.

This diagram can then in turn be converted in a system diagram that explains how the app is affected by the user and vice verca.

So from the actions between the user and the app in the documentation above the minimum amount of pages would be:
- a page that displays data
- a page that inputs data
- a page that changes data
From the above the following mockup was created.
